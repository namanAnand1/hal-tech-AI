agent that allows me to trade stocks using natural language input
connecting it LLM 
and trading stocks using ALPACA 

(theoretical input can be hey i wanna buy an apple stocks at 200 dollars a share)
(response from the system , processing --> simultaneously, backend should be sending the request after processing)
(validate the information completely during the processing the information) 
the actual system side--> backend should be basic ,along with the reactapp , if there is a successful paper trading request. 

Tools--> 
IDE , vscode, cursor (autocompletion), login accounts for GPT, documentation for alpaca is present   


user input --->(validation on top of the auth layer)
large language model     (interupts due to incomplete prompt)=>(frontend)       ---->          backend----> alpaca request ----> backend ---->sent to frontend as a response
-----------> n types of user actions 
             1. sell_shares/buy_shares action
                 {
                   creds:
                   language input: output--> quantity details, proposed price (optional), what exactly do we wanna buy/sell
                   }
             2. know the share price
                {
                  language input: output --> what shares do you wanna trade (to get the quoted price of those shares)
                  }
             
  language input processed--->{action-object}
  incase of action object not containing required data (means quantity , or type or anything valueable) return a response here only


alpaca request

here ammend the parts of action-object into the request, some keys and unique ids or secret keys(+what the users want to do along with required data)
LLM part ---> 

first thing is when we receive the string, we expect 3 things out of it
0. regular expression,-->keywords , such as buy,sell,trade,prices,quantity
tools calls usage---1.if buy/sell, quantity, price, identity.
---2.if knowing status, identity.
3.status of the shares brought () // a feature to be added , not primary

make a function, to pass the string through an LLM / make a request to an llm using a function
1.if buy/sell, quantity, price, identity.
2.if knowing status, identity.
on the basis of the result of the function, we will first validate the action (knowing requires idetity,buying requires  quantity, price, identity.)

converted into an object which will contain the action and corresponding data


the model can be provided with tool calls, json structures, 

unstructured input
